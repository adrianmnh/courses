# **CSCI 381 - Data Modeling and Advanced Database Systems**

What is a fully qualified object in MYSQL?

- No concept of ownership in MySQL, thus table names are in the `User.TableName` format
- CamelCase

- GDPR : European Union General Data Protection Regulation(applies to global companies)

- Dynamic Data masking : Hiding information based upon provildge. Supported by most ANSCI SQL databases

# Data Modeling, Governance and Quality

Data Governance is often referred to as the **people, processes, and policies around data** and information. These are critical to the success of any implementation

**Technical Infrastructure** supports the diverse data environments that run the business

Data models can be the critical **link between business definitions and rules and the technical data systems taht support them.** Without their valuable metadata, governance lacks the robustness to be applied in operational and reporting systems

Self Service data prep and analytics add complexity, as a **more diverse set of users has access to manipulate, model, and report on enterprise data**

How to integrate governance to **balance Enterprise Standards with Self-Service Agility?**

## **What is a Data Model?**

A data model translates regulations, policies and procedures to the Technical Data System & Structures that support them

**Technical Metadata** describes the structure, format, and rules for storing data

**Business Metadata** describes the business definitions, rules, and context

**Data** represents actual instances

## Business vs Technical Metadata

Business Metadata|Technical Metadata
-|-
Definitions & Glossary|Column structure of a database table
Organization information|Domains, data type and length
Privacy and Security levels|Keys, validation rules, permissions
Acronyms and Abbreviations|Standard Abbreviations

**What is a customer?**
* A customer is a person or organization who purchases a product or service from...**VS**
* CUST_LNM is VARCHAR(30) on Oracle db CustDB1

## Human Metadata

Much business metadata and history exists in employee's memory(*AVOID*)

Capture this metadata in an electronic format to share with others

## Publishing Business Definitions in a Data Model

**Data Models** are a great place to store business definitions
* Display them on the model for a business audience
* Store them in the model repository for reuse across the organization (various users, tool, etc)

## Creating a Technical Data Inventory
Linking business definitions to technical implementations
* Data models and the associated metadata can create a real-world inventory of the data storage associated with key business data domains in the control of a data governance program

## Data Lineage
Metadata for CUSTOMER exists in a number of tools and data stores
* This lineage can be tracked in many data modeling tools and associated metadata and governance solutions

## Technical Metadata makes Data Governance Actionable
Data models are a good vehicle for this
* Data models can help take the **business rules and definitions in policies** and make them **actionable in physical systems**, maintaining a lineage and audit trail

## Data Quality Improvement
Why bother?

* 7.5 quintillion bytes on new data create everyday
* 90% of all data was created from 2015-2017
* Average business data volumes **double every 1.2 years** 

## Data Quality Problems
In a study involving 75 executives, only 3% found their departments fell within the minimum acceptable range of 97 or more correct data records out of 100
