# **CSCI 381 - Data Modeling and Advanced Database Systems**

**Prof. Peter Heller**
---
What is a fully qualified object in MYSQL?

- No concept of ownership in MySQL, thus table names are in the `User.TableName` format
- CamelCase

- GDPR : European Union General Data Protection Regulation(applies to global companies)

- Dynamic Data masking : Hiding information based upon provildge. Supported by most ANSCI SQL databases

# Data Modeling, Governance and Quality

`Data Governance` is often referred to as the **people, processes, and policies around data** and information. These are critical to the success of any implementation

`A management framework for data accountability and data improvement`

Business process owners need to come together to agree on terminology. Setting standards or logic to keep naming conventions intact so a framework can be built around it.

**Technical Infrastructure** supports the diverse data environments that run the business

Data models can be the critical **link between business definitions and rules and the technical data systems that support them.** Without their valuable metadata, governance lacks the robustness to be applied in operational and reporting systems

Self Service data prep and analytics add complexity, as a **more diverse set of users has access to manipulate, model, and report on enterprise data**

How to integrate governance to **balance Enterprise Standards with Self-Service Agility?**

## **What is a Data Model?**

`Data Modeling is the visual representation of data relationships and their physical storage in technical platforms`

A data model translates regulations, policies and procedures to the Technical Data System & Structures that support them

**Technical Metadata** describes the structure, format, and rules for storing data

**Business Metadata** describes the business definitions, rules, and context

**Data** represents actual instances

***All Personally Identifiable Information (PII) must be anonymized for the purpose of information sharing between departments***

## Business vs Technical Metadata

Business Metadata|Technical Metadata
-|-
Definitions & Glossary|Column structure of a database table
Organization information|Domains, data type and length
Privacy and Security levels|Keys, validation rules, permissions
Acronyms and Abbreviations|Standard Abbreviations

**What is a customer?**
* A customer is a person or organization who purchases a product or service from...**VS**
* CUST_LNM is VARCHAR(30) on Oracle db CustDB1

## Human Metadata

Much business metadata and history exists in employee's memory(*AVOID*)

Capture this metadata in an electronic format to share with others

## Publishing Business Definitions in a Data Model

**Data Models** are a great place to store business definitions
* Display them on the model for a business audience
* Store them in the model repository for reuse across the organization (various users, tool, etc)

<img src="/dm/01-03.png">

## Creating a Technical Data Inventory
Linking business definitions to technical implementations
* Data models and the associated metadata can create a real-world inventory of the data storage associated with key business data domains in the control of a data governance program

<img src="/dm/01-04.png">

## Data Lineage
Metadata for CUSTOMER exists in a number of tools and data stores
* This lineage can be tracked in many data modeling tools and associated metadata and governance solutions

<img src="/dm/01-05.png">

## Technical Metadata makes Data Governance Actionable
Data models are a good vehicle for this
* Data models can help take the **business rules and definitions in policies** and make them **actionable in physical systems**, maintaining a lineage and audit trail

<img src="/dm/01-06.png">

## Data Quality Improvement
Why bother?

`Data Quality is the approach and tools used to improve data accuracy, completeness and consistency`

* 7.5 quintillion bytes on new data create everyday
* 90% of all data was created from 2015-2017
* Average business data volumes **double every 1.2 years** 

## Data Quality Problems
In a study involving 75 executives, only 3% found their departments fell within the minimum acceptable range of 97 or more correct data records out of 100

## Industry Statistics
Raw data used in Self-Service Analytics and BI environments is
often so poor that many data scientists and BI professionals
spend an estimated 50 – 90% of their time cleaning and
reformatting data to make it fit for purpose.

Correcting poor data quality is a Data Scientist’s least favorite
task, consuming on average 80% of their working day

The US economy loses $3.1 trillion a year
because poor data quality

Lack of effective Data Governance and the absence of shared
data definitions and metadata cited as main impediments to
the success of Data Lakes

## Why Data Quality and Data Governance can FAIL
* Lack of business leadership and commitment
* Failure to link DQ/GV to organizational goals and benefits
* Failure to focus on the data that really matters
* Giving people data responsibility but not equipping them to succeed
* Placing too much emphasis on monitoring and not **data improvement**
* Thinking new technology alone will solve the problems
* Forgetting DQuality/DGovernance must **embrace all who use data** across an organization
* Not delivering business value early and regularly

`Problems often emerge far away from the cause` - Newtown's Cradle Effect

<img src="/dm/01-07.png">

Know what to manage closely and waht to leave alone

*As a general rule, **the more data is shared across and beyond the organization, the more formal governance needs to be***

## The Rise of Self-Service **Business Intelligence, Analytics and Data Prep**

The interest in self-service data reporting has increased among data-savvy business users
* Availability of tools and data sets has made it easier for business people to **do their own data manipulation and reporting**
* Offers great opportunities, can also become challenging
* Data modelers and the models & metadata they create can make the job of business intelligence easier for both BI priofessionals and the casual BI reporting user(Enterprise-wide, standardized data)
* What about non-standard, non-relational, and discovery data?

1. **Glossaries, data models** - Published documentation, metadata, standard definitions
2. **Self-Service data prep and analysis tools** - integration of data sets with self explored data for analysis and modeling
3. **Master Data, Data Warehouse** - standardized data sets
4. **Data Cataloguing & Crowdsourcing** - Leveraging existing work, filtering by most relevance

It is important to find the right balance when implementing successful data governance in today's self-service data landscape

* **Standards-based Governance** - suited for enterprise-wide data standards
* **Collaboration-based Governance** - open souce, suited for self-service data preparation & analytics

These two methods **work well together**, depending on the data usage

## Usage Ranking

- Which queries are others using?
- Which tables are accessed the most?
- Which glossary terms are most often searched?

## Helpfulness Ranking

- Which definitions are most complete and helpful?
- Which algorithms offer a helpful starting point?
- Which queries offer great logic to share?

# Summary

`Data Governance requires a mix of people, processes and technologies`

`Data models & metadata support the policies & procedures defines by data governance`

`Data Model metadata supports actionable data governance through`
* Linking business & technical definitions & business rules
* Providing standardization & consistency
* Supporting data lineage & audit trails

`It is important to stablish the right level of governance for each unique data use case`

`Self-Service data prep & analytics require a new paradign for "crowdsourcing" metadata`

`A combination of standards-driven + collaborative governance provides a powerful mix that offers value across the organization`
