# Data Modeling, Governance and Quality

Data Governance is often referred to as the **people, processes, and policies around data** and information. These are critical to the success of any implementation

**Technical Infrastructure** supports the diverse data environments that run the business

Data models can be the critical **link between business definitions and rules and the technical data systems taht support them.** Without their valuable metadata, governance lacks the robustness to be applied in operational and reporting systems

Self Service data prep and analytics add complexity, as a **more diverse set of users has access to manipulate, model, and report on enterprise data**

How to integrate governance to **balance Enterprise Standards with Self-Service Agility?**

## **What is a Data Model?**

A data model translates regulations, policies and procedures to the Technical Data System & Structures that support them

**Technical Metadata** describes the structure, format, and rules for storing data

**Business Metadata** describes the business definitions, rules, and context

**Data** represents actual instances
