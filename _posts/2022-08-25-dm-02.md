## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 

Fundamentally protects and enables the privacy rights of individuals and establishes strict global privacy requirements governing how personal data is protected

Addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas

1. Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency
1. Purpose limitation
1. Data minimization
1. Accuracy
1. Storage limitation
1. Integrity and confidentiality
1. Accountability

## Dynamic Data Masking (DDM)

Limits sensitive data exposure (PII) by masking it to non-provileged users. It can be used to greatly simplify the design and coding of security in application

`Personally Identifiable Information(PII)`

A masking rule may be defined on a column in a table in order to obfuscate or mask sensitive data

DDM has some limitations and restrictions

## Hashbytes

Will be used to develop hashkeys

```sql
HASHBYTES ( '<algorithm', { @input | 'input' } )

```

SHA 256 - 32 bytes


UTF-8 

varchar - UTF-8 ASCII 1 byte per character
nvarchar - **Unicode enconding**, takes 2 bytes per character

varchar(3) - 5 bytes

What is the problem with using nvarchar(1)?

It uses 2 bytes, a char variable type is sufficient
